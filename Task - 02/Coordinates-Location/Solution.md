This Task was very helpful to understand linux commands.
Step 2 took some time because I had to figure out how all the commands work after that I was able to do all the tasks fast.
the command I used for this Task is as follows:
mkdir : used to crete a directory
ls : used to find out all the files in a directory
cd : to enter a directory
touch : to create a file in the directory
cat >> (Filename) : to enter something into the file 
cat : to read a file
cat (file names) > (filename) : used to move all the content from multiple files to a single file
mv (filename.txt) (copy.txt) : to change the name of a file
mv filename.txt ~ : move file.txt to home directory
cp ~/filename.txt ./North.txt : change the name and tore in a new directory
rm file.txt : remove a file
cd - : go one directory behind
vi filename.txt : also used to edit a file
