# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
First of all I am really interested in learing about computers but I wasnt able to work on tasks for two weeks as I was travelling, I was living in Kuwait for the past 14 years and now I moved to India so I was a busy with that.I was able to work on the task for only 2 weeks in total. I tried to do my maximum. Secondly, I will give my 100% to the tasks and assingments that will be assingned to me if I get to be in the team.  
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
In the next six months I want to explore the world of computer science as much as possible so that I can get some idea on the basics of all the fields so that I can choose a particular field that I can try to learn deeply

### How would you contribute back to the club?
If i get into the club and I will be able to gain knowledge from it...I will surely share my knowledge with others who needs it

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
Selection process is amazing..the club is so well planned like creating channels on discord, the tasks, the mentors everything was just great, even if I dont get a chance to get in the club, I have learnt a lot and if i get another to get in I will surely try again to get in.
