##  Install Ubuntu 20.04
I thought the task would easy for me but that was not the case, I had to change some settings in the boot menu so that I could run Ubuntu 20.04 Lts on my system. It took a lot of time but I somehow managed to figure it out. From this task I was able to learn differents setting in the boot menu like what is sata mode, AHCI, Secure Boot, etc. It was all new to me. Finally I installed Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and everything is working fine.:smile:
